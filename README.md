FitSmart is a user-friendly and versatile mobile health app designed to help individuals maintain their fitness and track essential health metrics even when they are offline. The app offers a range of exercise routines and health calculators to promote overall well-being and encourage a healthy lifestyle.

## Overview
The Fitness Calculator Menu is a mobile application that offers a comprehensive set of tools to help users assess and monitor various aspects of their health and fitness. It provides easy access to five different calculators: BMI, BMR, Body Fat, Body Shape, and Ideal Weight. Each calculator serves a unique purpose and empowers users to make informed decisions about their health and fitness goals.

Users can choose from a collection of 30-second exercise videos that can be performed anywhere, anytime, making it perfect for individuals with busy schedules or those who prefer short bursts of exercise.
2.	Offline Functionality: One of the primary highlights of FitSmart is its ability to work without an internet connection.
